Maybe some surface noise on quieter records. More apparent wear.\r\nG+ or G: Apparent wear and surface skuffs and scratches. A good play copy if it's a rare record. Still, no skipping. (G is even worse state of condition, still no skipping.)\r\nFair or Poor: Junk.\r\n\r\nWe ship to almost every country in the world. \r\nYou can find our rates here:\r\nBELGIUM\r\n1 - 20 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €7.50\r\n21 - 60 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €9.50\r\nFRANCE, GERMANY, NETHERLANDS\r\n1 - 20 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €17.50\r\n21 - 60 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €44.99\r\nEUROPA (Other countries)\r\n1 - 20 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €35.60\r\n21 - 60 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €86.99\r\nALL OTHER COUNTRIES\r\n1 - 20 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €55.50\r\n21 - 60 vinyl/CD/Cassette - €95.99\r\n\r\nAll prices are per registered shipment, tracking is NOT automatically included.
